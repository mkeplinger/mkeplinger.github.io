# What is PushCommerce?

PushCommerce solves the need to break free from the limiting confines of Shopify template engine.  It allows you to drop in a quick code snippet and then have access to all of your data from shopify.  This allows you to create offers to sell your products outside of Shopify, on Facebook, or host your entire ecommerce storefront in any website application, like Wordpress, Drupal, Joomla! or MODx easily.

The easy to follow and understand templating language allows you to get the data onto your HTML pages easily.


## Example Deployment

#### Step 1.  Drop supplied code into the footer of your site.

```html
<script src='//yourstore.pushcommerceapp.com/push-yourstore.js?v=20903'></script>
```

#### Step 2.  On each page you want to grab Shopify data, call the data inline with this simple call.  
__The example below will call the "frontpage" collection data from Shopify, which includes data about each of the products in that collection.__

```html
<script type="text/x-pushcommerce-tmpl" data-src="/api/v1/collection/frontpage/">
```

#### Step 3.  Use our supplied template language to add dynamic Shopify content on the page.  
__The call to the API and the template codes are all wrapped in one `<script type="text/x-shopify-connector-template">` tag.  Note the type of text/x-shopify-connector-template.  That is how the app knows where to insert the dynamic content.  
Everything in the `{{ }}` curly braces is content from Shopify.__

```html
<script type="text/x-pushcommerce-tmpl" data-src="/api/v1/collection/frontpage/">
	<img class="img-circle" src="{{image}}" width="193px" height="185px">
	<h2>{{title}}</h2>
	<div class="collection-body">
		{{{nohtml body_html 30}}} // strips out HTML and show the first 30 characters
	</div>
	<p><a class="btn btn-default" href="/product/{{name}}">View details</a></p>
</script>
```
